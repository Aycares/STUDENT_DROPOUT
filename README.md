üéì **STUDENT DROPOUT PREDICTION**

üìå ***What This Project Is About***

Every year, schools and universities lose students who drop out before completing their studies. This is a serious problem because it affects both the students (lost opportunities, wasted time and money) and the schools (lower graduation rates, wasted resources).

This project uses data and machine learning to predict which students are most at risk of dropping out. By making these predictions early, schools can step in to provide support ‚Äî like academic counseling, financial help, or mentoring ‚Äî before it‚Äôs too late.

**About the Data**

The data I used contains real information about students‚Äô backgrounds, family situations, academic performance etc.

Examples of what‚Äôs included:

Student information: age, gender, nationality, scholarship status

Family background: parents‚Äô education and jobs

Academic record: grades, number of courses taken, attendance (daytime or evening), previous qualifications

Economic conditions: unemployment rate, inflation, GDP (because the economy can affect dropout rates)

The outcome (what we‚Äôre trying to predict) is whether a student:

Dropped out

Graduated

Enrolled

**What I Built**

I built a full end-to-end system that:

Takes student data (from a file or input form).

Cleans and prepares the data so the model understands it.

Trains a machine learning model that learns patterns linked to dropout.

Evaluates the model to check accuracy, recall, and reliability.

Deploys the model as a web service (API) so schools can send in a student‚Äôs details and instantly get a prediction (e.g., ‚ÄúThis student is at high risk of dropping out‚Äù).

***Why This Matters in the Real World***

For schools: Helps identify students who need support, so they can reduce dropout rates.

For students: Increases chances of staying in school and successfully graduating.

For policymakers: Provides insights into the biggest risk factors (like financial struggles or poor first-year performance) that lead to dropout.

Imagine a school administrator uploading new student records into this system. Within seconds, they would know which students need extra attention. This allows them to act before the dropout happens ‚Äî turning data into real change.

**Key Results**

The system successfully predicts students at risk of dropping out with good accuracy.

Factors like first-year grades, parents‚Äô education level, and financial status turned out to be strong indicators of risk.

The model was designed to prioritize recall (catching as many at-risk students as possible), since missing even one struggling student could have a big impact.

**How You Could Use It**

A university could integrate this model into their student management system.

A government education department could use it to spot regional dropout patterns.

A school counselor could run a student‚Äôs details through the model before each semester to see who might need more support.

***About Me***

I created this project to apply data science to a real social problem: education and student success. It combines technical skills (machine learning, Python, APIs) with a mission-driven outcome ‚Äî helping more students graduate.
